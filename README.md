## Description

Breast Cancer Detection using Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a machine learning project that aims to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on features extracted from medical images. SVM is a popular classification algorithm that can effectively learn to separate two classes by finding an optimal hyperplane that maximizes the margin between them.

This project demonstrates the implementation of SVM for breast cancer detection and provides a classifier that can be used to predict the likelihood of a tumor being malignant or benign, assisting medical professionals in making more informed decisions.

## Introduction

Breast cancer is a significant health concern worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving treatment outcomes. This project uses a dataset of medical images, along with corresponding labels indicating whether each tumor is malignant or benign. SVM is used as the machine learning algorithm to train a classifier on this data, and the trained model can be used to make predictions on new, unseen medical images.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be obtained from [source_link_to_dataset](link_to_dataset). It contains a collection of medical images of breast tumors, along with corresponding labels denoting whether each tumor is malignant or benign. The dataset is split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
